          The name Treesury is a combination of the word 'tree' and 'treasury.'
          The main aim of this project is to raise awareness about trees and
          demonstrate their value to our environment, we should protect them as
          thought they were something of value like gold.

          Treesury is a project that is inspired by Earth Day. Every year,
          climate optimists celebrate this day to commemorate our commitment to
          keeping planet earth sustainable. Treesury has a specific focus on
          trees and includes data about many tree family groups.

          The first Earth Day was focused on the United States. In 1990, Denis
          Hayes, the original national coordinator in 1970, took it
          international and organized events in 141 nations. On Earth Day 2016,
          the landmark Paris Agreement was signed by the United States, the
          United Kingdom, China, and 120 other countries. This signing satisfied
          a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft
          climate protection treaty adopted by consensus of the 195 nations
          present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris.
          Numerous communities engaged in Earth Day Week actions, an entire week
          of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world
          faces. On Earth Day 2020, over 100 million people around the world
          observed the 50th anniversary in what is being referred to as the
          largest online mass mobilization in history.
