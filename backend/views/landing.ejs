  <p>The name Treesury is a combination of the word 'tree' and 'treasury.' The main aim of this project is to raise
    awareness about trees and demonstrate their value to our environment, we should protect them as thought they were
    something of
    value like gold.</p>

  <p>The first Earth Day was focused on the United States. In 1990, Denis Hayes, the original national coordinator in
    1970, took it international and organized events in 141 nations. On Earth Day 2016, the landmark Paris
    Agreement was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and 120 other countries. This signing
    satisfied a key requirement for the entry into force of the historic draft climate protection treaty adopted by
    consensus of the 195 nations present at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Numerous
    communities engaged in Earth Day Week actions, an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that
    the world faces. On Earth Day 2020, over 100 million people around the world observed the 50th anniversary in
    what is being referred to as the largest online mass mobilization in history.
